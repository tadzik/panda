An initial Perl 6 grammar for JSON.

This is a work in progress. For more information please join #perl6 on
irc.freenode.net, and talk to moritz_ or viklund, or write a mail to
perl6-users@perl.org.

To build and test this module, plese get 'ufo' from
http://github.com/masak/ufo and run

    ufo
    make
    make test

(installation is not yet supported; you can do that manually by copying the .pm
files from lib/ recursivley in your ~/.perl6/lib/ dir; installing .pir files
is discouraged, since simple changes in Rakudo will render them worthless,
might result in confusing errors).

State:

    The parser is pretty complete, if you find anything that it should
    parse and doesn't, or the other way round, please let me know.

    The emitter works.

    Both currently ignore possible surrogate pairs.
