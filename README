A simple Perl 6 module for serializing and deserializing JSON.

All files (unless noted otherwise) can be used, modified and redistributed
under the terms of the Artistic License Version 2. Examples (in the
documentation, in tests or distributed as separate files) can be considered
public domain.

To build and test this module, please get 'ufo' from
http://github.com/masak/ufo and run:

    ufo
    make
    make test

(You would normally be able to install this with panda, but it happens to be
one of the prerequisites for panda itself -- so until Rakudo does automatic
recompiles, panda will become very confused after completing the install.
New, tested versions of this module should be imported into panda's source
in ext/JSON__Tiny/, and panda's reboostrap.pl run.)

State:

    Works.

Missing features:

 * Correct handling and tests for surrogate pairs
 * Detection of cycles in input data structures (might never be fixed)
