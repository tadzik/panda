An initial Perl 6 grammar for JSON.

This is a work in progress. For more information please join #perl6 on
irc.freenode.net, and talk to moritz_ or viklund, or write a mail to
perl6-users@perl.org.

State:

    The parser is pretty complete, if you find anything that it should
    parse and doesn't, or the other way round, please let me know.

    The emitter works.

    Both currently ignore possible surrogate pairs.
