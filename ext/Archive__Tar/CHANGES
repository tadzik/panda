1.64 09/07/2010
- Removed the PERL_CORE specific chdir from all the tests
- Apply a patch from David Muir Sharnoff RT #58916,
  "skip files via a callback and limit memory use when skipping files"
- Apply a patch from Daphne Pfister RT #59150
  "Assumes all references filename are IO::Handle's instead of trying to stringify."

1.62 28/06/2010
- Apply part of patch from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=426194
  reported by Martin Cermak in RT #58636 relating to a Redhat ticket
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=606813

1.60 23/04/2010
- Apply patch from Darrell K. [RT #54850] that makes write() and create_archive() close only handles
  they opened.

    When you pass a filehandle to Archive::Tar::write() or create_archive(),
    it closes the filehandle after writing to it. I think it makes more
    sense not to close a handle that A::T didn't open, since the application
    may need to write additional data to it. (Consider sockets, package
    files containing encapsulated tar archives, etc.)

    Example:

    $ perl -e 'use Archive::Tar; open(PKG, ">mypkg") or die "open: $!"; my
    $tar = Archive::Tar->new; $tar->add_data("foo.txt","hello");
    $tar->write(\*PKG); print PKG "more data" or die "print: $!";'
    print: Bad file descriptor at -e line 1.

- Fool the installer into replacing our scripts that were installed by core with versiononly set.

1.58 17/02/2010
- Apply a patch from toddr@null.net that addreses RT #54714

  Subject: $@ not cleaned up after eval

  This section of code seems to be trying to use future functionality
  not yet present in IO::Zlib (tell). I was chasing another bug and getting very confused
  by this population of $@. Could I request you cleanup $@ if you expect and/or don't care
  about failure from this eval?

1.56 03/02/2010
- Apply a patch from Mark Swayne that addresses RT #50471;

  Archive::Tar generates file headers with space padded numbers for size,
  mtime and checksum. This format is incompatible with some versions of
  the busybox implementation of tar (I am using 1.13.2), which requires 0
  padded numbers (despite comments in the source that say otherwise).

  I've included a patch that adds a control flag that enables zero padded
  numbers in the header. It passes all tests with ActiveState Perl 5.8.8
  on WinXP.

1.54 10/09/2009
- Apply a patch from Niko Tyni (ntyni@debian.org) that resolves RT #48879;

    As seen in [rt.cpan.org #48879], although the recommended way of
    retrieving the last error is to use an instance method ($tar->error),
    the returned value is effectively global: an error in one Archive::Tar
    instance changes the error string of another instance.

    This change separates the error strings from each other while keeping
    the (deprecated) global value of $Archive::Tar::error pointing to the
    last error regardless of its instance.

    We also support calling error() as a class method (Archive::Tar->error).
    In this case it returns the global value, which matches the old behaviour.

1.52 13/06/2009:
- Apply documentation patch to describe IBM APAR issue IZ50240; AIX tar
  does not always end a Tar archive with a 0x00 null block, which can
  cause warnings from Archive::Tar.
  This is a documentation patch only, and users of 1.50 need not upgrade.

1.50 12/06/2009:
- Apply patch in #46450: Support for --no-same-permissions style behavior
  This facilitates leaving the +x bit, while still applying your umask on
  the extracted file.

1.48 20/04/2009:
- Address #44680 (Improve error reporting on short corrupted archives)
  Archives of less than 512 bytes would not have a clear error string set
- Requires at least IO::Compres::* 2.015, to address: #43609: Memory
  problem with A::T. Turns out 2.012 was leaking memory.

1.46 05/03/2009:
- Address: bug #43513: [PATCH] Accept wrong checksums from SunOS and HP-UX tar
  like GNU tar does. See here for details:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#SEC139
- make COMPRESS_BZIP and COMPRESS_GZIP constants actually work and fix their
  documentation

1.44 19/01/2009:
- Address #41798: Nonempty $\ when writing a Tar file produces a
  corrupt Tar file
- Textual fix to Makefile.PL diagnostics

1.42 13/12/2008:
- Address #40426: Archive Tar to support direct Archive::Tar::File adds
  It is now possible to add Archive::Tar::File objects via $tar->add_files
- Address #40016 (Archive::Tar assumes $> won't change): CAN_CHOWN is now a
  dynamic check upon extraction. This allows scripts to drop privileges when
  desired
- Address take 2 of #39933: [PATCH] handle ../ directory name on VMS
  John M. sent in a better way to do directory name translation.

1.40 13/10/2008:
- Add $class->has_zlib_support and $class->has_bzip2_support to
  discern which A::T can support
- Address: #39933: [PATCH] handle ../ directory name on VMS (core patch)

1.39_04 08/09/2008:
- Address: #38932: pax_global_header extracted as file
  Don't extract these special files, which are added by, among
  others, git-generated tarballs. It holds a comment and is not
  meant for extraction. This follows gnu tar 1.14 and later behaviour
- Address: #19577: extract_file() drops volume part of extraction path
  Windows users can now extract files to a different volume

* important changes in verison 1.39_03 26/08/2008:
- Because all the IO::Compress modules are interlinked, they must be
  the same version when installed, or breakage will occur like shown
  at this tester report:

    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/08/msg2083310.html

  Mailed the author to find a less fragile solution, but for now we require
  all the individual modules, and all at the same version.

1.39_02 25/08/2008:
- Address #31806: Please add support for bzipped tar files.
  Archive::Tar now supports reading/writing tar.bz2 files.
- Since IO::Zlib is now core, it is now a default dependency.
- Added Package::Constants as a dependency to ease the use of A::T::Constants
- Dependency on IO::Compress::Bzip2 and IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 is on
  by default, but can be negated with the -n switch when building:
  'perl Makefile.PL -n'
- Improve documentation on the new ->iter function

1.39_01 22/08/2008:
- Address the second part mentioned in this report:
  #30380: directory traversal vulnerability in Archive-Tar
  Archives are no longer allowed to extract into symlinked directories,
  unless Insecure Extract Mode is enabled (which is off by default).
- Add regression tests for this behaviour
- Address #33669 (Could not update timestamp warning on symlinks)
  Don't update timestamps on symlinks, they'll modify the original
- Apply core patch: [patch@33971] Archive::Tar was building corrupt
  archives on VMS as supplied by John Malmberg
- Address #37375: ptar should allow '-' as an archive_file name
  Patch provided by glenn jackman
- Add convenience method ->extract() to A::T::File
- improve docs of A::T::File by adding rv & object in the header
- Address #38580: [PATCH] Archive::Tar-&gt;iter
  This adds an iterator to Archive::Tar, thanks to Gisle Aas

1.38    14/12/2007:
- Promote 1.37_01 to stable.

1.37_01 11/11/2007:
_ Address #30380: directory traversal vulnerability in Archive-Tar
  - Add $INSECURE_EXTRACT_MODE which defaults to 0, disallowing
    archives to extract files outside of cwd(). This is a backwards
    incompatible change from 1.36 and before.
  - Add a -I option to ptar to enable insecure extraction if needed

1.36 16/9/2007:
-   Portability fixes for VMS, as offered by Craig Berry.

1.34 15/8/2007:
-   Address #28687: Fwd: Unespected reaction of Archive::Tar
    A::T didn't always handle filenames that evaluated to false
    (like '0') gracefully. This patch adds a few 'or defined' check
    to the A::T codebase and a test to ensure filenames like '0' are
    handeled correctly.
-   Apply #28407: Unicode and Archive::Tar - documentation patch as
	FAQ patch

1.32 25/7/2007:
-   Apply #28407: Unicode and Archive::Tar - documentation patch as
    FAQ patch
-   Following a report from rgs that A::T 1.31 doesn't play nicely
    with -Dmksymlinks under perl core, rewrite the symlink logic in
    A::T::File->new to continue building an object when reading a
    symlink fails, rather than refusing to read on a symlink (which
    is obviously wrong)
-   Quell warnings when a gid is not resolvable to a group name

1.31 18/5/2007:
-   No longer use the t/setup.t and t/cleanup.t files but just bundle
    the binary files; this was done for core integration, but the new
    uupacktool.pl script means we dont have to do this anymore
_   Apply core perl Change 30997 by rgs@stcosmo on 2007/04/20 15:03:57
-   Address: #27124: Unneeded warning sent when checking for file
    inclusion contains_file() will no longer warn to STDERR when a file
    is not contained in an archive and $WARN is set to 'true'.
-   Address #26492: Dangling symlinks not preserved: Archive::Tar used
    to complain about dangling symlinks, unlike standard gnu tar, which
    would add them silently. This patch brings A::T's behaviour in line
    with gnu tar
-   Minor pod fixes

1.30 8/2/2006:
-   applied bleadperl patch: Subject: Change 27416:
    Cleanup Archive-Tar temporary test files
-   address #17985: INSTALLDIRS needs to be 'perl' for >= perl-5.9.3
-   address #18296: Archive::Tar 1.29 PATCH for VMS to fix test case
    failure in 99_pod.t
    (it's actually a File::Find bug, but this patch works around that)
-   address: #18720 ([PATCH] Archive::Tar creates POSIX style tar files
    unnecessarily and by default, leading to compatibility problems
    particularly with WinZip.)
    patch rejected, docpatch added with FAQ and SEE ALSO
-   apply performance patch from #20399 to enable the user to
    avoid repeated calls to cwd() if desired.

1.29 3/1/2006:
-   integrate bleadperl patches to generate the source files for
    testing, rather than bundling them
-   make extract* methods accept a::t::file objects too
-   address #17624: Unnecessary calls to cwd() -- cwd() is only
    called when needed
-   address #17935: Archive::Tar::write('file_name') should close
    or return file handle. -- filehandles are now closed
-   address #17395: [PATCH] allow extract() to select files by
    regexes or substrings; patch did not get integrated, but a FAQ
    on how to achieve this was added to the FAQ section
-   address #17310 (Archive-Tar 1.26_01 not tolerant to Archives
    with Garbage) -- Garbage protection should be much improved now

1.28 19/1/2006:
-   add pod to ptar and ptardiff so they have manpages generated
-   integrate change 25333 by rgs@oregon on 2005/08/27 16:28:27
    which fixes a failure in Archive::Tar tests when perl is built
    with -Dmksymlinks
-   integrate Change 26870 by craigb@craigb-brianor on
    2006/01/17 04:03:01 holding vms specific patches
-   mention 'full_name' as property type to list_archive
-   address #14922 -- unable to reproduce, but add a test
    case to make sure the issue doesn't occur
-   apply the docpatch provided by:
    #15935: File type constants are not documented
-   document our lack of support for stringified archives and
    compressed archives opened to a non-io-zlib fh
-   1.27 was skipped due to PAUSE issues

1.26 22/8/2005:
-   the 'ptardiff' was not included in the exe_files section
    of the makefile.pl, meaning it didn't get instaleld by default.

1.25 20/8/2005:
-   Move the changes into it's own file
-   Add patch from abeltje to make tests pass on VMS. This is *just*
    the tests -- code may need some extra work to be reliable  (#12678)
-   Add faq about accessing 'tar.Z' files, as provided by Paul Marquess
-   Add a warning if the read() call from new() fails to return data
-   Address #13636, where heuristics were 'upgrading' a file to a
    directory if the file had an @LongLink entry, and the shortened
    filename ended in a '/'.
-   Add ptardiff program as suggested by KWILLIAMS (#13658)

1.24 3/5/2005:
-   Fix a bug where alternate absolute extract paths would add an
    extra directory upon extract (bug #11342)
-   Added support for 'perlio' (available for perl5.8 and up).
    See the Archive::Tar documentation for details

1.23 3/12/2004:
-   03_file.t wasn't present in the MANIFEST

1.22 21/11/2004:

This release holds only bugfixes.
-   Make list_files() also return full_path() rather than name(),
    as that would ignore the prefix field. This was found to break
    PPM (bug #8537)

1.21 9/11/2004:

This release holds only bugfixes.
-   Make the size of symlinks be 0 in tar headers, so the next entry
    is not interpreted as contents of the symlink (bug #7937)
-   Strip high bits from the mode of the file, as they are stored
    differently in the tar header
-   Make Archive::Tar be kinder to archives that contain garbage,
    proceeding anyway as long as that's possible.

1.20 8/11/2004:

This release holds mostly bugfixes, in the form of a rewrite of
the handling of the 'prefix' header field.
-   Rewrote 02_methods.t to be more independant
-   Rewrote the way 'prefix' headers are dealt with
-   Require IO::String now to do archive stringification
-   Add new method 'full_path' to A::T::Item objects
    - this is used to fix bug 6938
-   A::T->new now accepts both a class and an object to be friendlier
    to users
-   On tar read errors, binary chunks are no longer dumped to STDOUT,
    but instead the error offset is reported

1.09 22/5/2004:

This release holds some bugfixes and also the return of bin/ptar
-   Make new() comply with the documentation and return undef on
    a read() failure.
-   Re-adds bin/ptar, which disappeared from this distribution after
    0.22 (sorry about that).
-   Makes 'IO::Zlib' a default prerequisite. You can still disable
    this by supplying the -n option to 'perl Makefile.PL'.

1.08 5/1/2004:

This release holds some bugfixes and extra tests over the 1.07 release:
-   Fix a file renaming bug that forgot to carry over path info
-   Fix a bug where adding dirs on win32 gave 'permission denied'
-   Fix some documentation typos
-   Add extra tests explicilty for Archive::Tar::File
-   Move completely from FileHandle to IO::File

1.07 17/10/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes over the 1.06 release:
-   Quell some annoying warnings about binmode on unopened filehandles
-   Add tests for binary files included in a tarball

1.06 15/10/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes and new features over the 1.05 release.
-   The chown() code somehow didn't make it into the 1.05 release
-   Patch _get_handle() to treat all IO::File handles as binary.
    This should make win32 users happy

New feature added:
-   A method called 'contains_file' that will tell you if a certain file
    is already in the archive.

1.05 23/8/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes and new features over the 1.04 release.
-   The Test::Harness that came with perl 5.6.0 was buggy, require
    a higher version in the Makefile.PL
-   Add a global variable $CHOWN that controls whether Archive::Tar
    should attempt to chown() files or not when it can.

1.04 27/7/2003:

This release hold a bugfix over the 1.03 release:
-   NULL-byte padding was done also on files that had no real content,
    like symlinks, thus ending up with a number of bytes not dividable
    by 512.

1.03 26/6/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes over the 1.02 release, mainly these:
-   Always do a readlink on the full path, never just the file
-   Make Archive::Tar write proper headers when dealing with symlinks
    For this $Archive::Tar::FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is introduced

1.02 12/6/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes over the 1.01 release, mainly these:
-   Silly thinko fix in File.pm
-   Quell some warnings if files are empty
-   The cache of previously added files was not being emptied

Also, some new features are added:

-   Archive::Tar::File objects now have a C<has_content> method.

1.01 5/6/2003:

This release holds some bugfixes over the 1.00 release, mainly these:

-   Silence some warnings when writing directories to disk.
-   A { } inside a map was interpreted as a block rather than a hashref
    constructor -- now fixed.
-   Fix write() to work again as advertised when passed no arguments.
-   This also means glob support to write is now definitely not
    available.
-   Silly thinko of where splitpath() instead of splitdir() was used.

Some new features/changes:

-   Add a new method 'has_content' to Archive::Tar::File.
-   Cygwin's tests will now also use the 'short' files, since cygwin
    is built on top of an Win32 filesystem.

1.00 31/5/2003:

This release marks the new development track as 'stable'. Version got
upped to '1.00'. Not many changes, merely lots of successful test
reports constitute this version. However, a tiny fix regarding the
reserved string 'VERSION' has been applied, as well as a few more FAQ
entries have been added.

0.99_06 5/5/2003:

This release only entails a bug fix on 0.99_05 -- C<extract_archive>
was dealing wrongly with special files such as hardlinks etc. This
is now fixed.

0.99_05 30/4/2003:

Apparently windows has some issues with long path names.
This version introduces an adapted test suite for Win32 machines.

0.99_04 28/4/2003:

Make Archive::Tar work happily on perl 5.005_03

0.99_03 28/4/2003:

This release only has bug fixes on 0.99_02.

Fixed handling of long file names when extracting with
C<extract_archive>

Fixed handling of prefixes in tar headers that contain regex meta-
characters.

Fixed a few spurious warnings about comparing non-numbers.

Expanded the test cases accordingly.


0.99_02 26/3/2003:

Added options to be passed to read, namely:
	- extract (to extract while reading)
	- limit (to limit the amount of files read from the archive)

Implemented the '././@LongLink' support, which is GNU's way of
dealing with filenames that are longer than 255 chars.

Added a global variable $WARN which controls whether warnings get
printed or just stored.

Fixed a few small bugs that considered files named '0' or '' to not
really be files and refuse to package them.

0.99_01 16/3/2003:

Total rewrite from the ground up. Removed as many as the nasty
bits (no pun intended) as possible and tucked them away.
No code from the old distribution remains.

Cleaned up the API, introduced clean error handling and just
generally removed a lot of cruft.

Note that Archive::Tar now requires perl version 5.005_03 or higher
to run.

Introduced 2 new submodules:
Archive::Tar::Constant
    Simply holds all constants, like block length, tar headers etc

Archive::Tar::File
    Object class for all files in a tar archive, to make for easier
    manipulataion of the archive in-memory.
    See perldoc Archive::Tar::File after installation.

Added a few features:
write() now takes an optional 3rd paramater (prefix) which will allow
you to tuck away all files in that sub directory.

rename() is introduced, allowing for easy renaming of files in the
archive.

get_files() returns a file of all Archive::Tar::File objects in the
current read-in archive.

0.23, 21/1/2003:

Bundled 0.072 and 0.22 to be able to work on Win32 and non-Win32
platforms. Since the previous version is almost 3 years old, bundling
seemed like the quickest way to get a working solution again.

Archive::Tar now transparently Does The Right Thing depending what
platform you are on -- Win32 users, read the Archive::Tar::Win32
documentation!

I also suppose this makes me the new maintainer...

0.20:

New class methods create_archive, extract_archive & list_archive.

Archive::Tar no longer keeps the entire archive in memory after
reading it.  This results in a major reduction in memory consumption.

Added suport for character & block special files.  These files are
currently created using mknod, so they will only be available on UNIX
platforms.

See the file ChangeLog for more complete details.

* important changes for version 0.08

Fixed (again) the MacOS support and included alpha support for
block/character special files as well as improving symlink handling.

NOTE: Archive::Tar is undergoing major work to extend the interface
and lower memory consumpton.  Any changes to the existing interface
should be extensions only.

* important changes for version 0.072.

Fixes a problem with systems that don't like open files being deleted.
It also has an explicit copyright notice so folks like Debian can
redistribute it in peace, and an new custodial maintainer due to
Calle's suffering Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

Get better soon, Calle!

* important changes for version 0.071

It fixes a bunch of bugs, implements POSIX-style long pathnames and
adds a couple of useful methods.  It has also been verified to work on
Win32.

This version also includes a small tar-lookalike program, ptar. There
is no documentation beyond a usage message, but if you've ever used at
Unix-style tar program it should be very familiar.
